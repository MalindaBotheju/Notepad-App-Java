### Database Setup
- No manual setup is required.  
- On the first run, the app will automatically create a file named **`notepad.db`** in the project folder.  
- Inside it, a table named `recent_files` is created:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recent_files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
